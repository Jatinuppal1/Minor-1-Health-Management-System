# Minor-1-Health-Management-System
A Software application for managing the Health records of Citizens. There are many types of diseases which can be spread in a mass population and can take long time for identification. Collecting such a big data from different locations like hospitals, clinics, etc is very difficult, and it’s more difficult to compile the data for further processing. This software will help in fetching out the necessary details from the collected mass data, and customize it according to the need and action required for controlling and managing a mass disease.
Health care management is evolving rapidly. And hence this project is aimed to manage the records of patients, and conclude a particular spread of disease as soon as possible. It can be achieved by implementing Data Structures and Big Data Analysis.
